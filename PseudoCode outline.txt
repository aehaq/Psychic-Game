define array which includes all letters
define array which includes player's valid letter choices

define remaining guess count (starts at 9)
define userScore = 0
define cpuScore = 0
define letters guessed so far as blank string

Create reset function which does the following:
			reset valid choices to full list
			reset remaining guess count to 9
			reset letters guessed so far
			cpu chooses a new random # generator


cpu chooses with random # generator (0 to 25)

when user inputs a valid letter, 
	if letter = cpuChoice
		then 	user wins, point added to userScore
			return message "You guessed it! Good Job!"
			run reset function

	if letter != cpuChoice
		then 	print letter on "letters guessed so far" ( add + " key" to string)
			remove letter from pool of valid choices (for loop)
			decrease number of guesses remaining by 1
			check:
				if remaining guesscount < 0
					then	cpu wins, add point to cpuScore
						return message "You Lose!
						run reset function
						

if user inputs invalid letter choice
	return message "Invalid letter choice"
